The project involves the development of a web application that emulates the core features of YouTube, one of the most popular video-sharing platforms. This YouTube clone will allow users to search, view, and interact with videos through a user-friendly interface built with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by the YouTube Data API obtained from Rapid API.
